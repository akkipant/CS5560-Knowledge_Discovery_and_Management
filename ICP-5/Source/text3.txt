It seems like it was a weekend of leaks. Pick your company: Samsung’s concept for AR glasses, replete with some far-too-chunky frames, or maybe the next generation of Apple’s AirPods, the in-ear kind.

These are two very different kinds of leaks. Samsung’s appears to be the sort of conceptual video tease that may, or may not, result in a device. Previous teases resulted in hardware that looked pretty different to the heady dream from years earlier. The company’s foldable phones are a great example, here.
